                Sinéad is discovering the joys of marriage, motherhood and, not least, mysticism. You can hear this in

                    <h4>Sinéad O’Connor featured on the cover of THE FACE in February 1990, beautifully and boldly shot
                        by
                        Juergen Teller and with the coverline: Shorn To Be Wild. <br><br>

                        When writer Sean O’Hagan met her in West London, she was on the cusp of a new phase of her life
                        and
                        her career, about to release the first new track from her second album I Do Not Want What I
                        Haven’t
                        Got. <br><br>

                        But no one could have foretold what came next. Nothing Compares 2 U topped the charts in 18
                        countries, including Ireland, the UK and US, becoming one of the best-selling singles in the
                        world
                        that year.
                        But all that, of course, couldn’t have been further from her mind at the time. As she told Sean:
                        <br><br>

                        “The songs [on the album] are about where I’m at. They unfold chronologically, so there are
                        still a
                        few, er, slightly angsty ones at the start of the record. Otherwise, the record is quite placid.
                        I
                        write
                        songs to convey texture and feeling [and] this one is about beauty, peace. I want to convey a
                        feeling of
                        prayerfulness. I don’t care if I’m coming over as a complete hippy because I’m being honest.
                        It’s a
                        very spiritual album. The songs are like prayers. Not literally, but insofar as they give off a
                        religious
                        feeling– spiritual happiness.” <br><br>

                        We’re proud to present Sean’s interview, online for the first time since its original
                        publication 33
                        years
                        ago.

        <p class="sentences">Up until very recently, Sinéad O’Connor confesses, her soft Dublin tones barely audible above the noise of
            the
            street outside, ​“I was this desperately unhappy person. Unhappy and fucked up. That was the main reason why
            I
            was going around being bolshy and aggressive to everyone. I was totally obsessed with my own unhappiness to
            the
            extent that I was making everyone around me unhappy as well. It’s only since I’ve gotten happy, that I
            realise
            how utterly awful I was. Now, I look back and think, what a wanker. What an absolute tosser. ​’Cos now I’m
            happy. Simple.” <br><br>
            There was a time, indeed, when Sinéad O’Connor’s middle name was Trouble. It seemed that every time she
            opened
            her mouth, controversy came crashing down around her unheeding ears. On the back of her critically-acclaimed
            1989 debut album The Lion And The Cobra, she rose to fame, here and in America, as the biggest, baddest
            mouth in
            pop. For a while, the music – anger-ridden, unapologetically adolescent, slightly hysterical – seemed like
            an
            appendage to the larger-than-life, tougher-than-leather public image. In DMs and Number One crop, she waded
            in
            where others feared to tread, badmouthing U2 till the whole of Dublin seemed intent on litigation, openly
            expressing a pro-iRA stance that made her tabloid target of the week. <br><br>
            The music press loved her, of course. She was the nouveau punk they’d been waiting for since Rotten hung up
            his
            bondage strides and bought a one-way ticket to Bel Air. She had it made. She looked great. And she gave good
            copy. <br><br>
            In the two years since, Sinéad has had a lot of time to think about the process that turned a shy girl with
            a
            shaved head into a media monster, albeit with her willing, and wilful, co-operation. Mostly, she thought
            about
            the personal fallout, the depressions and confusion that settled after the dust of yet another controversy.
            <br><br>
            “The whole U2 thing was the worst,” she admits, ​“and I don’t really want to drag it up again except to say
            that
            I was very messed up by it all, both mentally and physically. I think I was a convenient mouthpiece for the
            things a lot of people said in private. I also think I was set up, used by the pop press to sell papers.
            They
            never take the human being into account or the grief that sort of thing can cause. I don’t regret the things
            I
            said ​’cos they were true. What I regret is how I said them – cursing, screaming and shouting when I should
            have
            been totally clear.” <br><br>
            “Clear” is a word that recurs throughout this interview, alongside ​“spiritual” and ​“happy”. These are the
            key
            words in a post-epiphany Sinéad O’Connor vocabulary. Across a glass of additive-free, organic orange juice,
            the
            transformation that began almost a year ago is described in suitably serene sentences that almost always
            tail
            off into a broad and blissful grin. Gone is the anger, replaced by a placid, guilt-free equilibrium that
            finds
            creative fruition in a batch of new songs which will surface in April on her second album, I Do Not Want
            What I
            Haven’t Got. <br><br>
            “The songs are about where I’m at,” she says, ​“and they unfold chronologically so there are still a few,
            er,
            slightly angsty ones at the start of the record. Otherwise, the record is quite placid. I write songs to
            convey
            texture and feeling so, while The Lion And The Cobra was a bit histrionic, this one is about beauty, peace.
            I
            want to convey a feeling of prayerfulness. I don’t care if I’m coming over as a complete hippy ​’cos I’m
            being
            honest. It’s a very spiritual album. The songs are like prayers. Not literally, but insofar as they give off
            a
            religious feeling – spiritual happiness.” <br><br>
            She grins. Benign blissfulness incarnate. I gape back, mouth open, dumbstruck, preconceptions shattered. It
            sounds, I mutter, like you’ve been visited by The Holy Ghost. ​“That’s exactly what it feels like,” she
            says.
            <br><br>
            When Sinéad O’Connor arrived in London, a bruised, disaffected 17-year-old, her only thought was escape. The
            breakdown of her parents’ marriage and a spell in borstal following a string of offences had left a
            psychological scar that is forever linked to her birthplace. ​“When I go back to Dublin, the depression sets
            in
            as soon as I step off the plane. It’s like going back to a flat you used to share with an old boyfriend. I
            have
            nothing against the place or the people, but it’s just the personal connotations of Dublin. I don’t like it
            ​’cos I was never happy there.” <br><br>
            In London, Sinéad hooked up with Fachtna O’Ceallaigh, another Dublin exile with a colourful music biz
            history
            that included managing The Boomtown Rats in their ascendancy from pub rockers to punk pop stars. After a
            messy
            departure from U2’s Mother Records label, gleefully-documented in the Irish rock press, Fachtna began
            managing
            Sinéad and, in retrospect, was an indirect catalyst for her anti-U2 tirades. <br><br>
            “He’s my best friend and I look up to him,” she says, ​“and my natural inclination was to do something about
            my
            friend being upset. I felt really hurt by what they’d done to him but, in retrospect, I should have been
            more
            careful and realised that he probably did things to upset them as well.” <br><br>
            The continuing closeness of their friendship/​business relationship is evident from the fact that this
            interview
            took place in Fachtna’s West London flat. But, less than a week after our meeting, news reached my ears via
            sundry members of the music biz Murphia that Sinéad had sacked Fachtna as her manager. (The record company
            admitted the same and asked if all references to him could be expunged from the interview as they were
            ​“irrelevant”.) <br><br>
